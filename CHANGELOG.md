# Changelog

## 3.4.2
- [FIX] Rate-limit and stagger UDP probes, back off offline devices, and suppress unchanged HomeKit updates to prevent read/notification feedback loops from flooding the LAN
- [FIX] Prevent delayed `getPilot` replies from overwriting newer writes, while reconciling state after lost `setPilot` acknowledgements
- Thank you [@ulm0](https://github.com/ulm0) for [#178](https://github.com/kpsuperplane/homebridge-wiz-lan/pull/178)

## 3.4.1
- [FIX] Add a 2-second `setPilot` acknowledgement timeout so lost UDP acknowledgements no longer wedge later commands, while preserving newer queued cache state
- [FIX] Retransmit `getPilot` once and serve cached state immediately while refreshing HomeKit in the background, reducing "Updating…" delays on lossy Wi-Fi
- [FIX] Count coalesced probe timeouts once so one dropped reply no longer falsely marks a device offline
- Thank you [@ulm0](https://github.com/ulm0) for [#176](https://github.com/kpsuperplane/homebridge-wiz-lan/pull/176)

## 3.4.0
- [FEAT] Near-instant getPilot response — replaces the 50 ms debounce with in-flight request deduplication, and coalesces rapid setPilot calls so slider drags emit at most two UDP packets per device
- [FEAT] `discoveryInterval` config option — periodically re-broadcasts the UDP discovery packet so devices added after Homebridge starts are picked up automatically
- [FEAT] Offline detection rewritten around consecutive ping failures (configurable via `pingFailuresBeforeOffline`); offline devices fail HomeKit reads immediately as "No Response" and recover automatically
- [FIX] `lastStatus` no longer strips brightness/color/temperature changes — it now only applies to pure on/off toggles
- [FIX] `transformDimming` clamps to ≥ 0 so a device reporting `dimming=0` no longer sends a negative brightness to HomeKit
- [FIX] Refresh and discovery intervals are now cleared on Homebridge shutdown
- **Breaking:** `reportOffline` and `offlineThreshold` config keys are removed. Any `refreshInterval > 0` now activates offline reporting unconditionally (controlled by `pingFailuresBeforeOffline`, default 3). The refresh tick no longer re-broadcasts discovery — enable `discoveryInterval > 0` to keep the pre-3.4.0 DHCP-lease recovery behavior; the plugin logs a startup warning if you have refresh on without discovery.
- Thank you [@ulm0](https://github.com/ulm0) for [#175](https://github.com/kpsuperplane/homebridge-wiz-lan/pull/175)

## 3.3.4
- [FEAT] Optionally surface unreachable bulbs as "Not Responding" in HomeKit via new `reportOffline` config flag
- [FIX] Filter undefined fields before merging cached pilot state (prevents NaN brightness when firmware omits `dimming`)
- [FIX] Add fallback in `pilotToColor()` for empty cache entries (prevents crashes on color/temperature changes after timeout)
- Thank you [@dhananjaysathe](https://github.com/dhananjaysathe) for [#173](https://github.com/kpsuperplane/homebridge-wiz-lan/pull/173)

## 3.3.2
- [FEAT] Experimental support for Light Strips

## 3.3.0
- [FIX] Support for certain sockets that were misclassified as light poles
- [FEAT] Support Homebridge 2.0

## 3.2.1
- [FIX] Fixes the dimming math to correctly map 0% -> 10% 
- [FIX] Handles bulb not sending a brightness value, defaults to the on/off state of the bulb
- Thank you [@MoTechnicalities](https://github.com/motechnicalities) for diagnosing and responding to these issues

## 3.2.0
- [FEAT] Support for Wiz Plugs/Outlets

## 3.1.1, 3.1.2
- [FIX] Make scenes opt-in since it breaks light-grouping functionality

## 3.1.0
- [FEAT] Add support for scenes! Optionally disable this via `enableScenes` param since it removes your ability to tap on a tile to turn a light on/off
- [FEAT] Config UI for HOOBS
